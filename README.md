## Viewing the Site

You can open the pages directly in your browser by double‑clicking the
HTML files. For a more realistic experience (e.g., relative links and
`mailto:` forms working correctly), you can serve the site locally using
Python:

```bash
cd music_consulting_site
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your web browser. The
site is static, so no backend configuration is required.
